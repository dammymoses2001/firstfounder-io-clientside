              Just before we choose a founder to work with us, we try to
              understand the founderâ€™s profile and skills across four key
              dimensions:
            </p>
            <ul class="pl-4 my-5">
              <li>Entrepreneurial mindset</li>
              <li>Analytical Skills</li>
              <li>Communication Skills</li>
              <li>Tech Startup Ecosystem knowledge/expertise.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-5">
              The founders join at the very beginning of the venture, before the
              product building begins or teams formed, so that they can build
              and own the full journey. Sometimes, we start building before the
              founder comes but often times the technical founder comes first
              and start building the product.
