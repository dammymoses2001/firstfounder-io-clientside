              We have in-house startups that we hire founders to lead and manage
              for 20% equity while we take 80% and handle investments. The
              Founders-In-Residence Program identifies and selects founders who
              share in our vision and connects with our mission to run our
              startup ideas.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Just before we choose a founder to work with us, we try to
              understand the founder’s profile and skills across four key
              dimensions:
              <span className="fw-bold">
                Entrepreneurial mindset; Analytical Skills; Communication
                Skills; Tech Startup Ecosystem knowledge/expertise.
              </span>
            </p>
            <div className=" my-5">
              <p>
                The founders join at the very beginning of the venture, before
                the product building begins or teams formed, so that they can
                build and own the full journey. Sometimes, we start building
                before the founder comes but often times the technical founder
                comes first and start building the product.
